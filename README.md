# Tool Rental App

The Tool Rental App is a point-of-sale tool for a store, like Home Depot, that rents big tools.  The below functions have been implemented: 
- Customers rent a tool for a specified number of days.
- When a customer checks out a tool, a Rental Agreement is produced.
- The store charges a daily rental fee, whose amount is different for each tool type.
- Some tools are free of charge on weekends or holidays.
- Clerks may give customers a discount that is applied to the total daily charges to reduce the final
charge.
